Carnegie Hall (CH) Data Lab

## ABOUT

The Carnegie Hall (CH) Data Lab is a learning space for the Archives to experiment with innovative information technologies, and to expand our understanding of data-driven strategies and tools in an archival context.

## WHAT WE AIM TO DO

- Explore and demonstrate the opportunities related to linked open data, semantic technologies, and their application to Carnegie Hallâ€™s [performance history](http://data.carnegiehall.org/) and collection data
- Use the flexibility of a lab structure to explore and prototype solutions in an explicitly experimental environment
- Build skills internally and collaborate with external experts and communities
