## EXPERIMENT LABEL/TITLE
This Day in Carnegie Hall History

## TL;DR
See which events took place on this day for a given year in Carnegie Hallâ€™s history, and view the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the corresponding week.

# -verbose
We thought it would be fun to juxtapose Carnegie Hall events with the Billboard Hot 100 for that same week. While a majority of the events featured classical music, which won't align with the Hot 100, there have also been many rock and pop events which might. What can this tell us? Sometimes it's interesting to view historical data from seemingly unrelated domains; maybe it tells us nothing, or perhaps we learn something unexpected. *A note about the Billboard Hot 100: the charts are only available beginning with the week of August 4, 1958.*

## METHODS
We created a drop-down date selector for the year, with values displaying the years between 1958 and 2019. When a user selects a year, the form passes the chosen year as a variable to the Django view that formulates and sends a SPARQL query to [data.carnegiehall.org](http://data.carnegiehall.org/). Using SPARQL's ```FILTER``` expression, the query finds Carnegie Hall events from that year and today's month and day. The view takes the data returned from the view and uses uses Python's [dateutil.parser](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html) to grab the event date (YYYY-MM-DD), which it passes to a Python function to find the nearest Saturday (the Hot 100 for each week is published on Saturday):
```
def get_next_weekday(startdate):
      """
      @startdate: given date, in format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
      """
      d = datetime.strptime(startdate, '%Y-%m-%d')
      t = timedelta((12 - d.weekday()) % 7)
      # t = timedelta((7 + weekday - d.weekday()) % 7)
      return (d + t).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
```
That date is then appended to a URL for the Hot 100, which is conveniently and easily formatted like this: ```hot100_URL = ''.join(['https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/', hot100_date])```

Below is the SPARQL query for the Carnegie Hall events:
```
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
PREFIX event: <http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?event ?title ?date ?eventURL WHERE
{
  BIND(YEAR(NOW()) AS ?nowYear)
  BIND(MONTH(NOW()) AS ?nowMonth)
  BIND(DAY(NOW()) AS ?nowDay)

  ?event a event:Event ;
        dcterms:date ?date ;
        rdfs:label ?title .
  FILTER (YEAR(?date) = ' + year + ' && MONTH(?date) = ?nowMonth && DAY(?date) = ?nowDay)
  BIND(IRI(REPLACE(str(?event), 'http://data.carnegiehall.org/events/', 'https://www.carnegiehall.org/About/History/Performance-History-Search?q=&dex=prod_PHS&event=')) AS ?eventURL).
}
ORDER BY ?date
```

## CONCLUSIONS
### what we learned
We can use SPARQL's date and time functions to help us manipulate pointers to external date-based content, allowing us to compare and juxtapose Carnegie Hall events with information on historical trends or events from the same time period.

### further investigation 
It would be interesting to try a similar experiment contrasting Carnegie Hall events with other historical datasets (weather?), contemporary events, or newspaper/magazine articles.
