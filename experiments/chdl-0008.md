# Lab Report

## EXPERIMENT LABEL/TITLE
May 5, 1891 Across America

## TL;DR
Provide links to digitized front pages from newspapers across America published on May 5, 1891, Carnegie Hall's opening night, and plot them on a map by their locations.

# -verbose
The Library of Congress' <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/" target="_blank"><strong>Chronicling America</strong></a> site provides access to digitized pages from American newspapers published between 1789 and 1963. We wanted to use this wonderful utility to see what was happening across America on May 5, 1891, Carnegie Hall's opening night. To provide a more visually interesting and interactive display, we created a map with markers for each newspaper, plotted by the city in which each was published. Each map marker provides the name, location, and date of the newspaper, an image of the front page, and a link to view the complete May 5, 1891 edition of that newspaper.

## METHODS
We used Chronicling America's <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/#tab=tab_advanced_search" target="_blank">advanced search</a> feature to set a date range containing a single date, May 5, 1891. The search interface allows the user to limit the search to only the front page, or a specific page. We chose to limit it to the front page, in order to provide access to headines from that day. We left the search terms blank and didn't select any specific newspapers in order to return all possible front pages from May 5, 1891.

As for the rest, while we could have achieved our end more elegantly, sometimes quick and dirty is the easiest ðŸ˜¬. Results are returned as HTML in an unordered list. Using Google Chrome's Developer Tools, we isolated the correct HTML element containing the list of search results. By clicking next to the element, you can choose "Edit HTML" from a dialog box, which then displays just the contents of that element in its own text box. This allowed us to copy and paste the list into a text editor. Since our Data Lab site operates in GitHub Pages and each page is written in markdown syntax, we used this <a href="https://www.browserling.com/tools/html-to-markdown" target="_blank">online tool</a> to quickly convert the HTML list into markdown that we could paste into our Experiment page. The HTML results contained a few mistakes, e.g. an extra bracket inside the link text:

```*   [**Telegram-herald.** ([Grand Rapids, Mich.), May 05, 1891, Image 1]```

The offending bracket is the ```[``` inside the parentheses around Grand Rapids. While most browsers will ignore this and render the link correctly, in markdown it had the effect of wiping out the first part of the hyperlink text. Luckily, there were only two such instances in this result set and they were easily removed.


## CONCLUSIONS
### what we learned
It's fun to take advantage of some of the wonderful digital collections available on the web, of which <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/" target="_blank">Chronicling America</a> is a great example. Juxtaposing Carnegie Hall's history with contemporary events helps to provide context and depth to our history.

### further investigation 
We'd like to bring assets like these into our RDF data model for our <a href="http://data.carnegiehall.org/" target="_blank">performance history as linked open data</a> in order to facilitate dynamic querying to expose connected resources automatically.
