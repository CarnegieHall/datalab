# Lab Report

## EXPERIMENT LABEL/TITLE
Non-Classical Music Events at CH, by Genre

## TL;DR
Create a pie chart to show non-classical music genre labels and percentage counts, relative to the number of Carnegie Hall events that have a genre keyword assigned to them.

# -verbose

## METHODS
We created a SPARQL query to count the number of performances for each genre. We outline the use of genre at Carnegie Hall <a href="https://carnegiehall.github.io/datalab/2020/04/10/musicalgenres.html" target="_blank">here</a>, which includes the background to this query:

```
PREFIX event: <http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#>
PREFIX mo: <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
SELECT ?genreLabel (COUNT (DISTINCT?event) AS ?numberOfEvents) 
WHERE {
    ?event rdf:type event:Event ;
           mo:genre ?genre .
    ?genre rdfs:label ?genreLabel .
}
GROUP BY ?genreLabel
ORDER BY ?genreLabel
```

## CONCLUSIONS
### what we learned
While this genre chart serves as a nice visualization, it is an incomplete representation of musical genre at Carnegie Hall. Genre is not recorded on every non-classical music event, and our current set of genre vocabulary is not up-to-date or all-inclusive. We continue to face several genre challenges related to the limits of our database and to the inconsistencies of the overall genre discussion.

### further investigation 
Weâ€™re still wrapping our heads around our own internal discussion of genre and ask for feedback and/or responses to this chart and to any of the talking points in our <a href="https://carnegiehall.github.io/datalab/2020/04/10/musicalgenres.html" target="_blank">discussion post</a>. If you have done work similar to this or have also been tossing around musical genre questions in your mind, [contact](/contact.md) us or tweet using #CHDataLab.
