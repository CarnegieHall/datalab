# Lab Report

## EXPERIMENT LABEL/TITLE
How many works by Beethoven are performed at Carnegie Hall each year, on how many events?

## TL;DR
Create a line chart that correlates the number of works by Beethoven performed each year at Carnegie Hall with the number of events on which they were presented.

## -verbose
Since 2020 is the 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth, we wanted to create some Beethoven-themed data visualizations from CH’s linked open data. The chart answers the question “how many works by Beethoven are performed each year at Carnegie Hall, on how many events?”

Rationale: a single concert might include performances of more than one Beethoven work, e.g. an “All-Beethoven” concert featuring several piano sonatas. The scope encompasses any work written by Beethoven (including portions of works, e.g. a performance of only one movement from a sonata) and all documented CH events from the first performances at the Hall in 1891 until July 1, 2019 (the most recent update of data on data.carnegiehall.org).

## METHODS
We created a SPARQL query to 1) count the number of Beethoven works performed each year, and 2) count the total number of events on which they were performed:

```
PREFIX chnames: <http://data.carnegiehall.org/names/>
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
PREFIX event: <http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT ?yearOfEvent (COUNT(DISTINCT ?workPerf) AS ?numberOfWorks) (COUNT(DISTINCT ?event) AS ?numberOfEvents)
WHERE {
  ?work dcterms:creator chnames:1005833 .
  ?event dcterms:date ?date
         BIND (str(YEAR(?date)) AS ?yearOfEvent)
  ?event event:product ?workPerf .
  ?workPerf event:product ?work
}
GROUP BY ?yearOfEvent
ORDER BY ?yearOfEvent
```

We then created a Google Sheet using the query results, added a Smooth Line chart to visualize the data, and created an embed link for the chart to use on our Data Lab site.

## CONCLUSIONS
### what we learned
Google Charts are very easy to create, and with the embed option they provide an out-of-the-box tool to make nice data visualizations with no special development skills.

### further investigation 
Using Google Sheets/Charts for visualizations requires hosting the data in a personal Google Drive account. Ideally, we’d like to learn how to use a tool like D3.js to create chart visualizations on our own without having to host the data files externally.
Another option: we currently use Ontotext’s GraphDB for our RDF data. GraphDB’s Workbench user interface offers several data display options, including the ability to create a Google Chart .svg file directly from the UI. Adding the .svg file to our Data Lab site could provide a more direct method for visualization with a shallower learning curve than D3.js.
