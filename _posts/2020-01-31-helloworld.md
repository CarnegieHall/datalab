## A little about us 

**Carnegie Hall Data Labs launches today, January 31st, 2020!** 

The Data Lab is a learning space to expand our understanding of information innovation through experiments with linked open data, semantic technologies, and data-driven strategies that leverage the resources of the Carnegie Hall Archives. 

A primary goal of our Data Lab is to use Carnegie Hallâ€™s rich historical legacy as a lens through which to share untold stories and examine hidden connections within the world of music and other domains. The flexibility of a lab structure allows us to try out approaches and solutions in a "R&D" environment. 

Our investigations began in the work leading up to the 2017 release of Carnegie Hallâ€™s <a href="http://data.carnegiehall.org/" target="_blank">performance history as linked open data</a> and we are grateful and excited for the opportunity to continue experimenting. We hope to showcase what a relatively small staff, with rudimentary developer skills and limited technical support, can accomplish through our lightweight and exploratory linked open data initiative.  

Watch this space for updates about our experiments, posts about creating and taking the first steps with the Data Lab, and highlighting fun and interesting collaborations weâ€™re working on.   

## Where to start exploring?  

Check out the [Experiments]({{ '/experiments' | absolute_url }}) page. We are starting with 4 experiments that use Carnegie Hallâ€™s performance history (as linked open data) and built-in tools from [Wikidataâ€™s query service](https://query.wikidata.org/) to produce visualizations.  

Below each experiment is its own **Lab Report**, which includes an overview of what we made, details about the why and how, and what direction our curiosity, research, and testing will go as a result of the experiment. A draft template of a Lab Report is [here](https://carnegiehall.github.io/datalab/labreport.html), along with a list of GLAM* labs and resources we reviewed for inspiration for the site and the Lab Report contents.
