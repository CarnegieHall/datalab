The Data Lab is a learning space for Carnegie Hall to expand our understanding of information innovation through experiments with linked open data, semantic technologies, and data-driven strategies that leverage the resources of the Carnegie Hall Archives.

We strive to reinforce Carnegie Hallâ€™s role as a leading cultural heritage institution by investigating new ways to engage and educate by sharing a wider range of resources and context about our past, present, and future.
